# Pixel Dash TASing Code/Frontend
This project is for making tas tools for a game called [Pixel Dash](https://cmspeedrunner.itch.io/pixel-dash/).
This uses a copy of the game which is completely extracted with custom code being injected in through web console
Currently GUI frontend is being worked on for people who don't know how to use CLI Tools.


To compile this yourself you need nodejs and npm
