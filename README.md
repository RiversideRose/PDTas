# Pixel Dash TASing Code/Frontend
This project is for making tas tools for a game called [Pixel Dash](https://cmspeedrunner.itch.io/pixel-dash/).
This code uses an extracted asar using NPM + Pythons SimpleHTTPServer. Combined with using the debug console in your web browser, inputs can be edited frame by frame using the script that is the main feature here.
Currently a gui frontend is being worked on for people who don't know how to use Command Line Tools.
